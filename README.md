# Iris_Data_Analysis
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris flower dataset .
# Description:

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris flower dataset to understand the relationship between various flower features — specifically sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width — and to classify the three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

# Objectives:

Load and explore the dataset using Pandas and Seaborn

Perform data cleaning (if needed)

Visualize relationships between features using scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots

Analyze class-wise distributions and feature correlations

Build understanding for classification problems in machine learning

Tools & Libraries Used:

Python

Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)

Seaborn, Matplotlib (data visualization)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

# Key Insights:

Setosa is clearly separable from the other two species based on petal measurements.

There’s strong correlation between petal length and petal width, which is useful for model building.
